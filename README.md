# Word Chain Solver
 this project is was inspired by the word chain game. where you have to start with one word and get to another word by only chaning one letter at a time
 and all of the transitationary words have to also be valid words. for example "dog -> cog -> cot -> cat" is valid but you cant do something like "cat -> cag" as "cag" is not a word.

 this program automatically finds the shortest chain of words between any two given words assuming there is such a chain. 
 
 for this project I used SCOWL dict12 (the 3ofgame.txt file) for the dictionary/word list.
 the reason being other dictionaries like scrabble has too many arcaic and obscure words and i didnt want to include them.

 some chains that are fun to look at are 'petals' to 'cloudy' and 'exuding' to 'gussied'
